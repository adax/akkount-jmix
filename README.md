## Features

In short, the application solves two problems:
 1. It shows the current balance by all accounts: cash, credit cards, deposits, debts, etc.
 2. It can generate a report by expense and income categories that shows where the money came from and what they were spent on in some period of time.

Some details:
* There are _accounts_ that represent different kinds of money.
* There are _operations_: income to account, expense from account and transfer between accounts.
* A _category_ can be set for expense or income operations.
* The current balance is constantly displayed and is recalculated after each operation.
* Categories report shows the summary by two arbitrary periods of time to allow quick visual comparison. Any category can be excluded from the report. You can "drill down" into any row to see operations that comprise the row.
* The system has a fully functional mobile-friendly web UI.
